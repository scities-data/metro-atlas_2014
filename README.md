# US Metropolitan atlas 2014

Provides an Atlas of the US Metropolitan areas delineated for the 2014 American
Community Survey. Inspired by Mike Bostock's [us-atlas](https://github.com/mbostock/us-atlas).



## Features available

Data tabulation geographical levels for the 2014 US Census:

* Census Block Groups boundaries (blockgroups)
* Census Tracts boundaries (tracts)
* Counties boundaries (countries)

## Use

First clone the repository (chances are if you arrived here you know how to do
that). In the commande line, go in the folder where you cloned the repository, and type

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to install the python dependencies. Once that is done, you can simply type

```bash
make *geography*
```

to get the specified *geography* shapefiles (counties, tracts, blockgroups). The
program will download the necessary data, and the shapefiles will be available
in the folder `data/shp/cbsa_id`.

To get other geographies, type the name of other geographies in parenthesis
above instead of 'blockgroups'. If you type `make` alone, the program will
download and prepare all geographies.

CBSA Ids can be obtained by searching in the file `data/misc/cbsa_names.txt`.
