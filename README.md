# US Metropolitan atlas 2014

Provides an Atlas of the US Metropolitan areas delineated for the 2014 American
Community Survey. Inspired by Mike Bostock's [us-atlas](https://github.com/mbostock/us-atlas).

## Features available

Data tabulation geographical levels for the 2014 US Census:

* US boudaries (us)
* MSA boundaries (msa)
* Census Block Groups boundaries (blockgroups)
* Census Tracts boundaries (tracts)
* Counties boundaries (countries)

## Future features

The following features are obtained from the 2010 TIGER/Lines shapefiles and cut
using the 2000 boundaries. Considering the conversion of 2000 TIGER/Lines files
to shapefiles.

* Roads
* Water
* Landmarks

## Use

In the commande line, go in the folder where you cloned the repository, and type
(to get the blockgroups)

```bash
make blockgroups
```

The program will download the necessary data, and the shapefiles will be
available in the folder `data/shp/msa_id/`

To get other geographies, type the name of other geographies in parenthesis
above instead of 'blockgroups'. If you type `make` alone, the program will
download and prepare all geographies.
